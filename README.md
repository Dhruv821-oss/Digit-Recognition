# Digit-Recognition
This is an interactive web app built with Streamlit that allows users to draw digits (0â€“9) on a canvas. A trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model then predicts the digit from the doodle in real-time. The project demonstrates the power of computer vision and deep learning in recognizing hand-drawn input using a simple, intuitive interface.
